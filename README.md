# IVI_QML
This is the continuous HMI and application project which i am making for my own IVI system.
This is purely based on QML and QT and will be based on linux system (mostly raspberry pi).

Steps by step:
1. Creation of Audio Player
2. Creation of Video Player
3. Integration of Bluetooth service

THis can be treated as the reference project for the begineer in QT HMI and application side.
Suggetions are welcome.
